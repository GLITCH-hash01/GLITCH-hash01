# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Harikrishna A

ðŸŽ“ Computer Science Undergraduate at the College of Engineering Chengannur  
ðŸ’» Full-Stack Developer | AI/ML Enthusiast

I'm a passionate software developer with a strong focus on building meaningful, real-world applications. From disaster relief platforms to education and career support systems, I enjoy using technology to solve practical problems.  

With experience in both frontend and backend development, Iâ€™ve worked on projects involving scalable UI systems, data-driven dashboards, and interactive web platforms. Iâ€™ve also contributed to national and international initiatives through my roles with IEEE and industry internships.

Currently, Iâ€™m diving deeper into the world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, with the goal of integrating intelligent systems into impactful applications.

I believe in writing clean, maintainable code, collaborating with diverse teams, and continuously learning new things.
